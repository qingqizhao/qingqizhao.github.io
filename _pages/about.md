## About me

I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the **Stuttgart Center for Simulation Science, University of Stuttgart**, working with [Prof. Heng Xiao](https://www.hengx.org/) on **physics-informed and data-driven modeling of subsurface flow and transport**. I earned my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering at **Stevens Institute of Technology**, advised by [Prof. Cheng Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/chen-lab/home).

My work bridges **mechanistic modeling** and **modern AI** to build **predictive**, **physically interpretable**, **uncertainty-aware** tools. Earlier, I focused on **classical numerical simulation of subsurface flow**, especially **two-phase flow in porous media** for hydrogen storage, carbon sequestration, and petroleum recovery—experience that anchors my current hybrid approaches.

Looking ahead, I aim to advance **physics-informed, uncertainty-aware modeling** and **data assimilation** for **real-time inference** and **large-scale prediction** of **groundwater and contaminant behavior** to support robust, **decision-ready environmental and energy applications**.
