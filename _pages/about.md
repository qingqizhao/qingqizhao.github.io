## About me

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher at the Stuttgart Center for Simulation Science, University of Stuttgart**, where I focus on **physics-informed and data-driven models of subsurface flow and transport**. My research lies at the intersection of hydrogeology, geotechnical engineering, and scientific machine learning. I aim to bridge the gap between mechanistic modeling and modern AI by creating frameworks that are predictive, physically interpretable, and uncertainty-aware.

My recent projects include the development of an **end-to-end differentiable pore network model embedded with graph neural networks**, enabling permeability prediction directly from pore-scale images while maintaining consistency with physical laws. I am also advancing **Bayesian inversion frameworks for PFAS transport modeling**, integrating ensemble Kalman filters, variational inference, and multi-species data to jointly infer contaminant sources and aquifer parameters. These efforts highlight the transformative potential of combining mechanistic models with differentiable programming, adjoint methods, and machine learning to address urgent challenges in groundwater sustainability, underground hydrogen storage, and contaminant fate in the critical zone.

Before moving into data-driven and hybrid approaches, much of my work centered on **numerical simulation of subsurface flow** using classical computational methods. I have studied **two-phase flow in porous media**, with applications in underground hydrogen storage, carbon sequestration, and petroleum recovery. My doctoral and master’s work involved **reservoir simulation, multiphase transport modeling, and pore-scale numerical methods**, providing a strong foundation in computational hydrology and energy-related geosystems. This background continues to inform my current research as I integrate traditional numerical modeling with modern machine learning techniques.

Looking forward, my research vision is to establish a new generation of **physics-informed, uncertainty-aware modeling tools** for subsurface systems. These tools will enable real-time data assimilation, inverse modeling, and large-scale prediction of groundwater and contaminant behavior, supporting both fundamental science and practical decision-making in environmental and energy applications.
