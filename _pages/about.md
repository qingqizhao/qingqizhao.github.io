## About me

I’m a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the **Stuttgart Center for Simulation Science, University of Stuttgart**, working with **Prof. Heng Xiao** on **physics-informed and data-driven modeling of subsurface flow and transport**. I earned my **Ph.D. in Civil Engineering** at **Stevens Institute of Technology**, advised by **Prof. Cheng Chen**.

My work bridges **mechanistic modeling** and **modern AI** to build **predictive**, **physically interpretable**, **uncertainty-aware** tools. Recent projects include an **end-to-end differentiable pore network model with graph neural networks** for image-to-permeability prediction and **Bayesian inversion frameworks for PFAS transport**, integrating **EnKF/variational methods** and **multi-species data** for joint source and aquifer inference. Earlier, I focused on **classical numerical simulation of subsurface flow**, especially **two-phase flow in porous media** for **hydrogen storage**, **carbon sequestration**, and **petroleum recovery**—experience that anchors my current hybrid approaches.

Looking ahead, I aim to advance **physics-informed, uncertainty-aware modeling** and **data assimilation** for **real-time inference** and **large-scale prediction** of **groundwater and contaminant behavior** to support robust, **decision-ready environmental and energy applications**.
