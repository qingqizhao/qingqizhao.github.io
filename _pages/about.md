## About me

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Stuttgart** (Stuttgart Center for Simulation Science).  
My work focuses on **data-driven and physics-informed modeling of subsurface flows**, including:

- Groundwater modeling and simulation  
- Underground hydrogen storage  
- PFAS transport modeling  

**Research interests:** scientific machine learning; data assimilation; uncertainty quantification; subsurface flow simulation; and environment & energy applications (underground hydrogen storage, groundwater contamination, and carbon sequestration).
