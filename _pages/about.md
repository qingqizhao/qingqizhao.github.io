## About me

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Stuttgart**, working at the Stuttgart Center for Simulation Science.  
My research focuses on **data-driven and physics-informed modeling of subsurface flows**, with applications to:

- Groundwater modeling and simulation  
- Underground hydrogen storage  
- PFAS transport modeling  

My broader research interests include **scientific machine learning, data assimilation, uncertainty quantification, and subsurface flow simulation**, with relevance to **environmental and energy challenges** such as underground hydrogen storage, groundwater contamination, and carbon sequestration.
