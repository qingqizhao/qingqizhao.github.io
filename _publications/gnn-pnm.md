excerpt: "Porous media are widely distributed in nature and critical in applications such as oil and gas extraction, drug delivery, and filtration. This paper introduces a hybrid neural network architecture that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict porous media properties like permeability and formation factor. The model achieves nearly two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than a standalone CNN while maintaining superior predictive accuracy. The GNN Grad-CAM analysis provides interpretability by highlighting pore-scale features governing flow. <br/><img src='/images/gnn-pnm.png' width='520'/>"
