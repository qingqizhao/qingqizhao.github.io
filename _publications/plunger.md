excerpt: "Gas wells often suffer from liquid loading that reduces production efficiency. This study develops a transient plunger lift model to capture the dynamic interactions between gas, liquid, and plunger motion during deliquification. The model incorporates multiphase flow and wellbore dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of plunger performance and optimization of operational parameters. Findings provide insights into improving gas recovery and mitigating downtime in mature wells."
