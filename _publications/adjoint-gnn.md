excerpt: "This paper presents a hybrid modeling framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a pore network model (PNM) for permeability prediction. By replacing analytical conductance formulas with GNN-predicted values, the model preserves physical consistency while eliminating idealized geometric assumptions. <br/><img src='/images/adjoint-pnm.png' width='720'/>"
