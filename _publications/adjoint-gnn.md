collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/adjoint-gnn
excerpt: "This paper presents a hybrid modeling framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a pore network model (PNM) for permeability prediction. By replacing analytical conductance formulas with GNN-predicted values, the model preserves physical consistency while eliminating idealized geometric assumptions. The end-to-end differentiable architecture, enabled by a discrete adjoint method, allows training solely from bulk permeability data without requiring pore-scale labels, achieving high accuracy, scalability, and physically interpretable feature sensitivities."

  caption: "Overview of the proposed GNN-embedded pore network model: a GNN predicts pore-throat conductances from graph features, which feed a physics-based PNM solver to compute bulk permeability. End-to-end training via a discrete adjoint enables learning from only bulk measurements while retaining physical interpretability."
