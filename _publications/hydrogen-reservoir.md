excerpt: "Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) in aquifers requires careful consideration of cushion gases, which influence hydrogen mobility, dissolution, and production efficiency. This study employs a two-phase, three-component reservoir simulator with the GERG-2008 equation of state, benchmarked against experiments, to assess the role of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂ as cushion gases. Results show CO₂ promotes hydrogen dissolution and density-driven convection, while CH₄ and N₂ enhance production rate and mobility. <br/><img src='/images/hydrogen-reservoir.png' width='720'/>"
