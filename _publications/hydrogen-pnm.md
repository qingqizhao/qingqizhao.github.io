excerpt: "Understanding hydrogen–brine transport and the hydrogen trapping rate (residual/initial saturation) is critical for UHS site selection. We simulate two-phase H₂–brine flow with a 3-D pore-network model across sandstone, carbonate, and sand packs, using experimentally measured contact angles to quantify wettability effects. The PNM results show that less water-wet media (larger contact angles) yield lower trapping. Trained on PNM outputs, least-squares and SVM models classify high vs. low trapping (>50% vs. <50%) and predict trapping rates; rocks with low pore-to-throat size ratio and high connectivity are favorable for reduced trapping—highlighting the coupled roles of wettability and pore structure in UHS screening and design."
